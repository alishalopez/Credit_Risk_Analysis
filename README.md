# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview
Through this analysis we were able to determine whether loans were approved based on credit risk features. We used several machine learning models along the way, such as, Random Oversampling, SMOTE, Cluster Centroids, SMOTEENN, Balanced Random Forest Classifier, and Easy Ensemble Classifier.

## Results
The results for the different machine learning models are followed:
### Sampling Techniques

1. RandomOverSampler
* Accuracy Score of 65%
* Recall Score of .63
* Precision Score of .01
2. SMOTE
* Accuracy Score of 65%
* Recall Score of .64
* Precision Score of .01
3. Cluster Centroid
* Accuracy Score of 52%
* Recall Score of .57
* Precision Score of .01
4. SMOTEENN
* Accuracy Score of 64%
* Recall Score of .70
* Precision Score of .01

## Ensemble Techniques

5. BalancedRandomForestClassifier
* Accuracy Score of 79%
* Recall Score of .67
* Precision Score of .04
6. EasyEnsembleClassifer
* Accuracy Score of 79%
* Recall Score of .67
* Precision Score of .04

## Summary
All models seemed to be similar in scores. I do not feel as if any stuck out in particular, but overall the Ensemble Techniques performed slightly better compared to the Sampling Techniques. Using any of them would suffice.
